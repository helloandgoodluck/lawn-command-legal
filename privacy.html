        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 8, 2026</p>

        <p>Lawn Command ("the App") is developed and operated by Brett Adams ("we", "us", "our"). This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding your data.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your email address and password (stored securely via Supabase Authentication).</p>
        <p><strong>Location Data:</strong> We collect your address and geographic coordinates to provide accurate weather data, soil temperature estimates, and USDA hardiness zone calculations. Location is used only when you provide it during setup — we do not track your location in the background.</p>
        <p><strong>Lawn Care Data:</strong> Information you enter about your lawn, including grass type, zone dimensions, treatment history, mowing logs, and product inventory.</p>
        <p><strong>Photos:</strong> If you use the AI Turf-Check feature, photos are sent to Google's Gemini API for analysis. Photos are not stored on our servers after analysis is complete.</p>
        <p><strong>Weather Data:</strong> We fetch weather information from third-party APIs (OpenWeather, Open-Meteo) based on your location. This data is cached to improve performance.</p>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide personalized lawn care recommendations based on your grass type, location, and climate</li>
            <li>To calculate growing degree days (GDD), soil temperature, and seasonal guidance</li>
            <li>To track your treatment and mowing history</li>
            <li>To manage your product inventory (Digital Shed)</li>
            <li>To provide AI-powered turf diagnostics</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Supabase</strong> — Authentication and database hosting</li>
            <li><strong>Google Gemini AI</strong> — Turf image analysis (photos are processed and not retained)</li>
            <li><strong>OpenWeather API</strong> — Current weather conditions</li>
            <li><strong>Open-Meteo</strong> — Historical and forecast weather data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Storage & Security</h2>
        <p>Your data is stored securely on Supabase's cloud infrastructure with row-level security policies ensuring you can only access your own data. Passwords are hashed and never stored in plain text.</p>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p><strong>We do not sell, trade, or share your personal information with third parties</strong> for marketing or advertising purposes. Data is only shared with the third-party services listed above as necessary to provide the App's functionality.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
        <p>You can delete your account and all associated data at any time from the Settings screen within the App. Upon deletion, all your lawn data, treatment history, and product inventory are permanently removed.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is not intended for use by children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated "Last updated" date.</p>

        <h2>Contact</h2>
