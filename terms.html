        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 11, 2026</p>

        <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Lawn Command mobile application ("the App"),
            developed and operated by Brett Adams ("we", "us", "our"). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you
            agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

        <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>You must be at least 13 years of age to use the App. By using the App, you represent that you meet this
            requirement.</p>

        <h2>2. Account</h2>
        <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activity that
            occurs under your account. You agree to provide accurate information when creating your account and to
            notify us promptly of any unauthorized use.</p>

        <h2>3. Permitted Use</h2>
        <p>The App is provided for personal, non-commercial lawn care planning and tracking. You agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the App for any unlawful purpose</li>
            <li>Attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble the App</li>
            <li>Interfere with or disrupt the App's servers or infrastructure</li>
            <li>Use automated scripts, bots, or scrapers to access the App</li>
            <li>Resell, sublicense, or redistribute the App or its content</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. AI Features Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>The App includes AI-powered features (Turf-Check image analysis and Coach's Note summaries) that use Google's
            Gemini API. These features provide <strong>informational suggestions only</strong> and are not a substitute
            for professional lawn care, agronomic, or horticultural advice. We make no warranty regarding the accuracy,
            completeness, or reliability of AI-generated outputs.</p>
        <p>For more information about how AI is used in the App, see our <a href="ai-disclosure.html">AI Disclosure</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The App, including its design, code, graphics, and content, is owned by Brett Adams and protected by
            applicable intellectual property laws. Your use of the App does not grant you any ownership rights.</p>
        <p>Content you create within the App (lawn data, treatment logs, photos) remains yours. By using the App, you
            grant us a limited license to process this content solely to provide the App's functionality.</p>

        <h2>6. Subscription &amp; In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>Certain features are available only with a paid subscription ("Lawn Command Pro"). Subscriptions are billed
            through Apple's App Store and are subject to Apple's terms and cancellation policies. We do not process
            payments directly.</p>

        <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App integrates with third-party services (Supabase, Google Gemini, OpenWeather, Open-Meteo) to provide
            its functionality. We are not responsible for the availability, accuracy, or practices of these third-party
            services. Your use of these services is subject to their respective terms.</p>

        <h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>The App is provided <strong>"as is"</strong> and <strong>"as available"</strong> without warranties of any
            kind, whether express or implied. We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free
            of harmful components.</p>
        <p>Lawn care recommendations, weather data, growing degree day calculations, and AI-generated analysis are
            provided for informational purposes only. Always exercise your own judgment and consult qualified
            professionals for specific lawn care concerns.</p>

        <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Brett Adams shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental,
            special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the App, including but not limited to
            damage to your lawn, property, or equipment resulting from reliance on information provided by the App.</p>

        <h2>10. Account Termination</h2>
        <p>You may delete your account at any time from the Settings screen within the App. We reserve the right to
            suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms. Upon deletion, your data is permanently removed in
            accordance with our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h2>11. Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Changes will be reflected on this page with an updated "Last
            updated" date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

        <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, United States,
            without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>
